It was a very exciting and challenging project, CSE 335 Project 1, on which I worked for three to four weeks with my team members. We put in quite a great amount of effort into this project, meeting twice a week in order to brainstorm, code, and solve issues together. Other than that, we would also have a weekly meeting with our teaching assistant to clarify the complex concepts and any technical challenges that occurred during our process.

The project for this course entailed the design and then actually building from scratch a complex, interactive application. Due to time issues, we were unable to complete it, but nevertheless, it was an unusually instructive and enriching process. From this project, I gained practical experience in software development on a team, learned much about collaboration, code structure, and problem solving.

The most important feeling, though, was probably the team feeling or growth. In spite of all the problems, this project provided a real opportunity to apply and expand my technical skills in an applied manner on a real project, larger and more comprehensive than previous assignments. This underlined once more how time management and iterative development are key to meeting deadlines while producing quality work.

Overall, though we didn't finish, this was a landmark project in my academic career because it was one of the first really serious and teamwork-based programming exercises.
